    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 cups vegetable broth (or chicken broth)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp dried basil (or 1 tbsp fresh basil)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp sugar (optional, to balance acidity)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream or milk (optional, for creaminess)</li>
        <li>Fresh basil for garnish (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    <ol>
        <h3> Saute the onions and garlic: </h3>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and cook 
            for 5-7 minutes, until softened. Add minced garlic and cook for another minute, 
            stirring frequently
        </li>

        <h3> Add tomatoes and broth: </h3>
        <li>
            Pour in the crushed tomatoes and vegetable broth. Stir to combine.
        </li>

        <h3> Season and simmer: </h3>
        <li>
            Add the dried basil, sugar (if using), and season with salt and pepper. Let the 
            soup simmer for 15-20 minutes to allow the flavors to blend.
        </li>

        <h3> Blend the soup: </h3>
        <li>
            Use an immersion blender to puree the soup directly in the pot, or carefully 
            transfer the soup to a blender and blend until smooth.
        </li>

        <h3> Add cream (optional): </h3>
        <li>
            Stir in the heavy cream or milk for a richer, creamier texture. Heat for another 2-3 
            minutes, but <em>do not</em> let it boil.
        </li>

        <h3> Serve: </h3>
        <li>
            Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh basil if desired. Serve with crusty 
            bread or a grilled cheese sandwich.
        </li>
    </ol>
