    <h2> Instructions </h2>
    
    <ol>
        <h3> Prepare the meat sauce: </h3>
        <li>
            Heat olive oil in a large pan over medium heat. Add the chopped onion, 
            garlic, carrot, and celery. Cook until the vegetables are soft and the 
            onion is translucent.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the ground beef and pork. Cook until browned, breaking the meat 
            apart with a spoon
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another 2 minutes
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour in the red wine and cook until the wine has mostly evaporated.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Stir well, 
            reduce the heat, and let it simmer for at least 30 minutes, stirring 
            occasionally. The sauce should thicken and become rich in flavor.
        </li>

        <h3> Prepare the bechamel sauce: </h3>
        <li> 
            In a separate saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the flour 
            and whisk continuously to create a roux. Cook for 1-2 minutes without 
            browning the flour.
        </li>
        <li>
            Gradually add the warmed milk while whisking to avoid lumps. Continue whisking 
            until the sauce thickens and becomes smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
            Season with salt, pepper, and a pinch of nutmeg. Remove from heat.
        </li>

        <h3> Cook the lasagna noodles:</h3>
        <li>
            If using dried lasagna noodles, cook them in salted boiling water according 
            to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside. If using fresh 
            lasagna sheets, you can skip this step.
        </li>

        <h3> Assemble the lasagna:</h3>
        <li>
            Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).
        </li>
        <li>
            In a large baking dish, spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a layer of lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spread a layer of the meat sauce over the noodles, followed by a layer of béchamel sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sprinkle a handful of grated mozzarella and Parmesan cheese over the sauces.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat the layers until all the ingredients are used, ending with a layer of béchamel sauce 
            and a generous topping of mozzarella and Parmesan.
        </li>

        <h3> Bake the lasgana:</h3>
        <li>
            Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the foil and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbling.
        </li>

        <h3>Rest and serve: </h3>
