# odin-recipes
A basic html page containing the links to multiple recipes on my website.

In this project, I will show all the skills I have learned from the previous Odin Project lessons. These skills include:

- Creating the basic boilerplate for HTML pages
- Use basic header, body, paragraph tags
- Use anchor tags to create links to relative and absolute webpages
- Incorporate images within my webpage
- Use "ul" and "ol" tags to create lists
- Use the command line to effectively move between files and execute Git Commands
- Connect a project to git and follow Git conventions on commits and other procedures.
